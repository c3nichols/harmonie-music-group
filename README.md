# HARMONIE MUSIC GROUP

Harmonie Music group is formed of the ‘Harmonie Concert Band’ and ‘Voices in Harmonie’ choir. They are based in East Sussex and run by musical director Danielle Budden who is also a private music teacher.

In the past 12 months attendances at concerts have dropped, and after 11 years of rehearsing in the same place the band have recently been forced to change venue, resulting in several regular players now unable to attend rehearsals on top of an already growing number of vacancies so recruitment of new players is essential. 

Harmonie Music group use Facebook very effectively to promote themselves and show the vibrate fun side to the group, through photos, videos and up to date interactions. This platform does however not appeal to all potential audiences and can be difficult to search simple basic information quickly. A straightforward website giving an overview of the music group with clear links to information about wanting to join, or attend a concert/event would enhance the organisation’s presence online.

There is a current website which is very dated and not been kept up to date since 2014.

## UX (user experience)
The main objective of this project is to ensure people looking for Harmonie Music Group online can easily find information resulting in:
- Increased attendance at concerts and events
- Recruitment of more people to join, especially to the Concert Band
- Awareness that the band and choir exist and who they are, as there are groups of similar names in different parts of the Country.
The age range in the band and choir is quite vast from 8-year olds to 70+ year olds. The age range on average of those attending concerts and who often organise concerts on behalf of charities is 50 years+ and so consideration in the design will be to keep simple and straight forward to navigate.

### User Stories
1. I am 40 years old and recently moved to the area, I want to find a band to join. I used to play to a high standard but have not played for 15 years. I want to know what type of people are in the band and whether it is serious or more social. I need to have an idea of what kind of music they play, what instruments are in the band and if anyone is welcome or whether they are only looking for specific vacancies and have auditions to enter. **Is this band suitable? How do I join?**
2. I am 70 years old; my daughter plays in the band and although she will tell me when concerts are on I would quite like to look for myself so I can plan ahead and make sure we are free on the dates, so we don’t miss any. Having seen the band and choir in concerts I am also quite interested in finding out more about them and the people involved. **When are the concerts and events?**
3. I am organising a local fete and the band we usually hire is unavailable this year, my friend said they had heard of Harmonie so I will look on the internet to find out more about them. If they look suitable and are available for hire, then I would want to speak to the person in charge to ask more specific questions. **Is the group available to hire? Who do I contact?**
4. My son’s music teacher has recommended that he joins a band, Harmonie has been recommended but I would like to find out more about who they are, confirm when rehearsals would be and if he would be expected to play in concerts when and where they are likely to take place. **What kind of people are in the band? When are the rehearsals and concerts? How do I make contact?**
5. My mental health advisor has suggested I should join a local choir as I love singing but I am not very confident. I am looking for a fun, relaxed, sociable choir to join. That maybe doesn’t have too many commitments so if I was unwell it would be OK if I couldn’t attend sometimes. I am a bit nervous about joining to want to find out more information before I make contact. **Is the choir right for me? What is the commitment? How can I find out more before I make any contact?**

**The questions in bold were the key focus when I started to plan the site**

### Wireframes
I created page mockups using balsamiq, the files are saved in the wireframes folder.
*The main change to the actual finished site was a change to the main colour and decision to stick with just one that was slightly more delicate and subtle.*

## Features
The site uses real photos throughout to add colour and visually show the people involved. 

The *Acme* font was chosen using google fonts; seen as clear, slightly quirky and showbiz with the angled edges and the *Roboto* font complimented it.  It was important to have clear readable text and spacing.

The colour often used by the band is a royal blue, although most performances the band wear black and white. Use of the royal blue on the website did not portray the message needed so with some consultation and use of the Canva.com colour wheel, the gold colour was chosen as it can compliment the blue colour where needed and adds an aspect of amateur showbiz sparkle to the site!

### Existing features
- Navigation bar allows users to select logo to return to home page, menu titles set with smooth ease in and out transform feature to show clear movement when selected and set with a slight shadow. The word ‘Home’ has been omitted from the dropdown box instead allowing users to select the logo for the home page.
- Header image set the same on all pages to show consistency, titles added with block text on all but the home page to show user clearly where they are. Title text drops under image for small screens so balance of image and text size could be kept.
- Main content on pages all responsive, and apart from contact form all other blocks of information are arranged in groups of three/thirds, so content is in easy to digest blocks. 
- Contact us form – kept simple to allow users to contact with any type of message linked to email. Considered more advanced features like dropdowns but decided it would over complicate it for the user and the music group would not expect a high volume of messages. Name, email and message set to required.
- Concerts and Events page has a list of past events, this is hidden on small screens as quite a large amount of text and not deemed vitally important information.
- Jumbotron with photo and link to concerts and events page is in the middle of all pages to make navigation to that key information easy to find. Also visually breaks up the page.
- Card links with images, icons, text and transform hover movement placed at the bottom of each page to give a clear engaging lead on key perceived user requirements and actions. Also provides a large clickable area to navigate for users with lower fine motor skills and/or weaker sight. There has been a clear and careful omission of these links on the pages where the user is currently viewing so every clickable link takes a user to a new page.
- Footer kept simple, clear and consistent, easy to find social media links each opening in new browser window so as not to lose a user from website if they chose to click.
- Favicon added to browser tab to add a small detailed and elegant touch for the more observant desktop user!

### Features left to implement
- The music group do not currently have an online booking system for concert tickets but by creating the concert and events page in such a way that each event has its own box an additional feature could be to transform the box to a ticket booking link site. It could also include a feature where the box just shows the concert date and when selected rotates to reveal further information.
- When the contact us form has been submitted a “thank you/received message we’ll be in touch” would be a user- friendly additional future feature.
- A scrolling bar under the header image could also be introduced with key headlines, like upcoming concert, amount raised at an event, looking for players etc. this could energise the site if used over time.

## Technologies Used
1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Cloud9 IDE used as a workspace to develop project.
4.	GitHub (https://github.com/) to save repository and deploy site.
3.	Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) used for responsive grid system and used templates for navigation bar with toggle, jumbotron and cards for good UX.
4.	Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) used to search and select best main and complementary fonts to use for site design and UX.
5.	Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) used for icons to enhance and decorate.
6.	W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) used to research and view ideas for code to use particularly for forms and photo gallery.
7.	Canva colour wheel (https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) used chose a colour base for site design.
8.	Autoprefixer (https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - used for testing CSS.
9.	W3 Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) used for testing HTML.

## Testing
**Websites used to help validate and test code**

Autoprefixer CSS online (https://autoprefixer.github.io/) used to check CSS. 
- Highlighted that webkit, moz, o needed adding to the transitions in my CSS project file.

W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org) used to check HTML
- Picked up that h1 had been used in middle of the page Jumbotron and was not top level. I changed it to h3 although it had a Bootstrap Class of Display-4 so didn’t actually need a heading.
- Picked up use of ‘&nbsp’
- Showed errors in favicon image insert line at top of html pages for browser tab and use of – double hyphen in the comments, as this was not in the actual code I did not act on it.

Quirktools (http://quirktools.com/screenfly/) used to check for varying screen sizes up to 3840px
- all checks OK

Google Developer Tools – used regularly throughout website development to check layout and responsiveness and test whether features were working. Also useful to play around with changes on screen and checked format right down to iPhone 5 as well as iPad.

Github pages – used to deploy website, images and page links were not working due to file pathways being absolute and not relative. This was highlighted through errors in the console tab. Used Find feature in Cloud9 to help find links to change. Also realised a number of image file names were not industry fit as had some with capital letters and hyphens so changed along with the relevant links.

**User story testing**
1. A user who wants to join the band or choir will be given basic information on the landing page and then a *Join us* link either in the navigation menu or if they have scrolled down the page in a fairly large image link at bottom of any page. They can also see pictures throughout the site or in the gallery of the band in action and the people involved to get a flavour of the group.
2. I actually sent the site link to a 70+ year old couple who attend Harmonie concerts and have adapted to the use of websites to find information but don’t use social media. A summary of their feedback was:
⋅⋅* thought the site was cheerful and inviting to look at
⋅⋅* well laid out and not confusing, easy to navigate and find way back
⋅⋅* liked the use of lots of pictures of the actual people
⋅⋅* observed that it was easy to find the Facebook link even though they wouldn’t use it!
⋅⋅* clear instructions on how to contact the group
⋅⋅* everything they thought they would need was easy to find
3. The organiser of an event looking to hire the band will have basic information about the group and the director including what she looks like as soon as they arrive on the site. There is a clear *contact us* in the navigation menu and at the bottom as an image link on all pages. They can also see what dates the band are currently busy on the *concerts and events* page and also what type of events they have done in the past.
4. A parent who wants to find out about their child joining, will see from the photos that other children are also in the band, they will see what the Musical Director looks like and how to make *contact* on the front page. If they would like to attend a concert the dates, venues and times are available. By selecting the *join us* menu item in the navigation or the image link lower down the pages they are given a paragraph of text with key information with the **day and time of rehearsals** in bold so can pick up instantly. Key for parents as if other commitments on that day the decision to join or not can be instant.
5. A person wishing to join the choir but with potential anxiety will see the *key information* quickly by navigating the 5-page site and through seeing the photographs and clicking on the *social media links* in the footer be able to get an idea quickly of the type of people involved and that it is fun and relaxed. They will also see on the front page a picture of the person who they would be contacting and who leads the choir.

**Manual testing**

Using Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari I have looked through each page and clicked on each link to check connections, hovers and transitions. I also filled in the contact us form with varying details to check for errors and feedback messages when inputs not correct. I also posted on Slack peer-review to get feedback.

Through this process I discovered and fixed:
- links in the text on the join us page to contact page were still absolute and not relative pathways as were the jumbotron links to the Concerts and Events page. 
- peer-review feedback that hover items were too jumpy and abrupt so added softer transition for hover off and hover on.

## Deployment
The page was deployed from the GitHub repository to GitHub pages with the following steps:
- Within the repository went to **settings**
- Scrolled down to GitHub pages
- Selected source (Master Branch)
- Saved
- Confirmed repository name
- Scrolled back down to GitHub pages section
- Selected link provided next to “Your site is ready to be published at”
- Cut and paste in to new browser tab

The only difference in appearance to the developer mode was the omission of all images and 404 errors for internal page links. I was in communication with my mentor who pointed out it was likely to be that the links were absolute and not relative so I researched the solution and corrected the issues. There were no other differences.
